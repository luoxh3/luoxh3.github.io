## üîç About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in **Psychological Statistics and Psychometrics** at Beijing Normal University (BNU), under the supervision of **Prof. Hongyun Liu**. My research focuses on **Intensive Longitudinal Analysis**, **Multilevel Modeling**, **Structural Equation Modeling**, and **Bayesian Estimation**. I am particularly interested in exploring dynamic processes, time-related issues, and heterogeneity in psychological data, with applications in clinical-health and developmental psychology.
