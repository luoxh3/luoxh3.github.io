## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in **Psychological Statistics and Psychometrics** at Beijing Normal University (BNU), under the supervision of **Prof. Hongyun Liu**. My research focuses on **Intensive Longitudinal Analysis**, **Multilevel Modeling**, **Structural Equation Modeling**, and **Bayesian Estimation**. I am particularly interested in exploring dynamic processes, time-related issues, and heterogeneity in psychological data, with applications in clinical-health and developmental psychology.

## Research Interests

- **Dynamic bidirectional relations** in discrete-time and continuous-time models (e.g., feedback effects, predator-prey models).
- **Time-related issues** in intensive longitudinal data (e.g., temporal misalignment, timescale mismatch, optimal time intervals).
- **Incorporating qualitative distinctions** to improve heterogeneity analysis in mixed-effects models.
- **Test reliability** estimation and interpretation in intensive longitudinal studies.
- **Planned missingness designs** in intensive longitudinal studies.
- **Within-person variability** in intensive longitudinal data (e.g., non-varying individuals).
- **Machine learning methods** in intensive longitudinal analyses.
- **Applications** of intensive longitudinal techniques in clinical-health and developmental psychology.
