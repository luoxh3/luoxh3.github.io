## ‚õµ Research Journey

Over the past few years, I've been navigating my way along the continuum from applied to methodological research. I'm deeply grateful to all the mentors who have guided and supported me throughout this journey. 

Ultimately, I aim to **bridge applied and methodological research**, developing innovative methods and grounding them in practical, real-world studies.

## üí° Research Interests

- **Dynamic bidirectional relations** in discrete-time and continuous-time models (e.g., feedback effects, predator-prey models).
- **Time-related issues** in intensive longitudinal data (e.g., temporal misalignment, timescale mismatch, optimal time intervals).
- **Intensive longitudinal interventions**: Dynamic modeling and effect evaluation.
- **Incorporating qualitative distinctions** to improve heterogeneity analysis in mixed-effects models.
- **Reliability** estimation and interpretation in intensive longitudinal studies.
- **Planned missingness designs** in intensive longitudinal studies.
- **Within-person variability** in intensive longitudinal data (e.g., non-varying individuals).
- **Machine learning methods** in intensive longitudinal analyses.
- **Applications** of intensive longitudinal techniques in clinical-health and developmental psychology.
